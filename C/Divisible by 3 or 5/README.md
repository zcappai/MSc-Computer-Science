# Divisible by 3 or 5
This simple program contains 2 functions:
* First function determines whether a number is divisible by 3.
* Second function determines whether a number is divisible by 3 or divisible by 5.

Given 2 input integers, an array is populated with all integers between the 2 input integers.
Then by iterating over each number within the array and passing it to the 2 functions, it is determined whether the number is divisible by 3 and divisible by 3 or 5.
