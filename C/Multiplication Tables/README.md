# Multiplication Tables
This program contains 2 functions:
1. Calculates and prints square multiplication tables.
2. Calculates and prints multiplication tables between the range of 2 numbers.

The program takes 1 input for the 1<sup>st</sup> function. For example, an input of "5" would result in a 5x5 table starting at 1x1 and ending in 5x5.

The program takes 2 inputs for the 2<sup>nd</sup> function. For example, an input of "5" and "10" would result in the 5 times table, through to the 10 times table. But each times table only prints the 1<sup>st</sup> 10 numbers.
