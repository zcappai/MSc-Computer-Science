# Longest Cycle
This program takes a given dictionary and returns the length of the longest *cycle*. 

In this case, a cycle is a repeating sequence of elements found by using the *value* of one element as the *key* of another element, e.g. if 1 maps to 4 which maps to 2 which maps to 1, this will be represented as:
{1: 4, 4: 2, 2: 1} with a cycle length of 3

The dictionaries can also have more than 1 independent cycle.
