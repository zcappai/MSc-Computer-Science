# Recursive Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture that concerns a sequence in which, no matter which value starts the sequence, it always reaches 1.

The implementation is written recursively.

The algorithm:
1. Start with a positive integer n.
2. If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
3. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
